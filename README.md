## Flexbox layout

### Some important properties

- For setting the display flex

```css
div {
  display: flex;
}
```

- For aligning items at the center of an element when the flex-direction is set to row

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

_When flex-direction is set to column, the align-items will align the items horizontally and the justify-content will align the items vertically._
